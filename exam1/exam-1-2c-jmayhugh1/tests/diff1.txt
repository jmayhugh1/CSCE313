 Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
======================
 And both that morning equally lay
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
And sorry I could not travel both
======================
In leaves no step had trodden black.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
And be one traveler, long I stood
======================
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
And looked down one as far as I could
======================
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
======================
I doubted if I should ever come back.
